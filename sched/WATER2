Need:
	Water diffuses in ground slowly
	but seeks its own level quickly

	Ground falls like you'd expect.

	Erosion tends to level the landscape
	
	Fast

First shot:

Rules:
	Water never moves to a tile with more water than it
	Water moving through ground has a chance to move the ground with it.

Implementation:
	Select candidate destinations
	choose randomly between them
	if the water is moving from ground to air
	roll to see if the ground moves.
	
	repeat until no water in tile.
Problems:
	Doesn't address diffusion in ground.


Second shot:

Rules:
	Water on/in the ground never moves to a tile with more water than it.
	Water on the ground moves in the direction of the local minimum.

	water may move from air to ground, taking turns proportional
	to the difference in their water contents and the to do so
        (need a counter).
	
	iff the water level of a ground tile is high enough, water in that
	tile may move, but may bring the ground tile with it.

	Water in the ground moves randomly, but respecting previous rules.

Problems:
	How to find local minimum.
