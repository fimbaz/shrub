New rule: 
Water won't move to wetter tiles unless they're downhill.
Water moves randomly in the ground, and in the air just above the ground.


DONE:
X- free Water comes from y=0 and propagates downward in air.
X- If it is not absorbed by a plant cell, it passes through*.
X- A plant cell may bind up to one unit of water per turn. 
X- Plant tissues can hold a certain amount of bound water**.


TODO:
X- One unit of bound water is required to produce one unit of photosynthate.  
Bracketed features are optional/difficult/advanced
Advanced mechanics:
[X- A tile can hold a maximum of X units of free water, and is saturated at that point]
[O- Saturated free water on a ground/air border moves toward a local minimum]
XX- free Water diffuses underground
[X- free Water takes a unit of underground resource with it when it moves (if available).]
Tentative/Experimental:
[OO- Saturated in air may displace its nearest ground tile, severely damaging the cell there]
[O- Water leaving a tile damages cells in the tile]
[X- A cell that holds zero units of bound water will quickly die (once death is a thing).]


Expected time to implement all features:
OOOOOO

Expected time to implement basic features:
OO



*Adhesion may be an interesting phenomenon-- might be fun to let different plants have different adhesion factors, and watch
water walk around on their surfaces, but this isn't a high priority

**possibilities here:  
-let plant tissues hold as much water as they want, but cause them to take damage if they hold too much (requires damage implementation)
-Fix max holding capacity on a per-tissue basis (this isn't ideal-- we prefer adaptive tradeoffs if possible, but would serve for a first pass).

***exact mechanism unknown, and will require some experimentation.  Ideas:
-Random distribution (too slow!)
-Each cell gives 1/8 of its nutrients to each neighbor every turn (is this really different from random?)

****think about erosion.  Perhaps water moving from a ground tile may take the ground with it?  What about deep underground?  Too much moving water causes damage?
