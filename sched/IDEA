Tabular stream of dismissable/mouseover  of enlargeable images
rated by view-time

Workflow:
drag cursor around, linger over content you like.  Images move from right to left, may be grouped.
Use webGL?

Interactions:
Dismiss
move
group
optionally label
view labelled pictures in blob world (fullscreen available from there)

thoughts:
undismissed, ungrouped, unarchved picture follow your cursor around like lost puppies?
Or march toward the past-- grouped/favorite pictures fall off the bottomish leftish into a trough?

or ignored images shrink into oblivion.  Teeny world for infinitesimal images (trash) where they can be deleted.
Potential for human-assisted dup detection mode using simple computer vision.
