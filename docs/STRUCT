World:
	Plantae:
		Species:
			Props
			name (may be NULL)
			short unsigned int species (will be indexed by this value in Plantae)


	Animalia:
		Struct unclear
		animals know where they are,
		and can take actions against the board.
		probably on a different timer loop than plants.
		players maybe control these guys.

Plant representation is dense (one cell per [x,y] pair in the CA)
Animal representation is sparse.
Reasoning?  Plants need lots of information about their neighbors all the time,
plant cells don't move

Animals move, and may share [x,y] pairs with plants.  

Did this strategy pay off?
